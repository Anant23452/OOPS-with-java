__Idea Behind Exception
---Exception is unwanted or unexpected event whch occure during the execution of a prograam i.e ata run time ,t ath dusrupts program the normal fowo f the progra's instruction 

--Exception can be caught and handle by thr program 
--When an exception occure , jave crate an object that represent error object call 'exception obj'-contain info about error it's type and where it happen in code

An Exception occur due to:
-ivalid user inpt 
-device falure
-loss of networok connection
-out of bound
-type mismatch
-openning an unawailable file
-database errr
-arithmetic error

Exception Handling
Excpeitn handling is a mechanism to hadnle runtime error such as class not foudn eception , io exceptin, sql exceptin remote exeption, etc. The main purpose of exception handling is to maintain normal application flow.


Typoe of exception
- Checked Exception: These are the exceptions that are checked at compile-time. The compiler checks whether the exception is handled or not. If not handled, it gives a compile-time error. Examples include IOException, SQLException, etc.
    These usually occur due to external issues like:

        File not found

        Network down

        Database issues

âœ… Common Checked Exceptions:

    IOException

    SQLException

    FileNotFoundException

    ClassNotFoundException


- Unchecked Exception: These are the exceptions that are not checked at compile-time. They are checked at runtime. Unchecked exceptions are subclasses of RuntimeException. Examples include NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, etc.
âœ… Common Unchecked Exceptions:

    NullPointerException

    ArithmeticException

    ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

    IllegalArgumentException

    NumberFormatException



- Error IN JAVA 
: These are serious problems that a reasonable application should not try to catch. Examples include OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError, etc. Errors are not exceptions and should not be caught.

Excepton Flow 
When an exception occurs, the normal flow of the program is disrupted. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) looks for a suitable exception handler to handle the exception. If no handler is found, the program terminates.


ðŸš¦ What is Control Flow in Exception Handling?

It means:

    "What lines will be executed and in what order, when an exception occurs or doesn't occur in a try-catch-finally block."

ðŸ”° Basic Syntax:

try {
    // risky code
} catch (ExceptionType e) {
    // handle exception
} finally {
    // always runs
}
